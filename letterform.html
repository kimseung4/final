      <h1>Letterform Basics</h1>
      <p>The Roman alphabet used in Western typography can be understood as a system of line drawings. The drawing of individual letters is archetypal; each form has been steadily codified and passed along over the generations. The archetypal form of a particular letter is what distinguishes it from other letters and makes it recognizable. Letterforms are iconic, so ingrained into Western consciousness that their visual form holds sway over the perception of other images—many objects remind us of letters. This proposition is profound, since the letters of our alphabet were originally derived from pictographic drawings—like the hieroglyphs of the ancient Egyptians—representing real-world objects. Western culture has evolved such that the image of the letter is preeminent over its pictorial origin. Its visual qualities drive modern typography at every level.</p>
