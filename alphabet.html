      <h1>Alphabet Variations</h1>
      <p>The construction of letterforms in the Roman alphabet remains largely unchanged after 2,000 years. As readers, we rely on the consistent forms of our letters to understand them. Their design is a syntax of line shapes, a visual grammar that allows us to know that we’re looking at a V rather than a U. Too much deviation from the master shape, and we lose our sense of the letter.
      And yet, there are thousands of different typefaces that we’re able to read with ease. Our alphabet’s letterforms are strong, simple structures, and this makes them very flexible for manipulation. A typeface is a closed system of stylistic exploration; the essential shapes of each letter are modified according to the same criteria in one typeface, and modified by other criteria in another. Each typeface has its own internal logic that, while subordinate to the essential forms of its letters, provides an unlimited range of expressive variation.</p>
