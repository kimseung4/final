<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Based on my personal experience as a graphic design student, I noticed that there weren’t enough materials that teach about typography and graphic design for middle and high school students. When I was studying graphic design during undergraduate studies, I wished that I had some basic understandings of typography and noticed that there weren’t materials that were friendly for middle and high school students. I decided to came up with a digital platform, called Type Fun-Damental, that are approachable and user friendly; and provide the preliminaries of typography and graphic design.</p>

Graphic design industry has becoming very large and popular as everything seems to be in a digital form now. As a result, the demand for graphic designers has been increasing rapidly. It’s also a fun and creative field; and I noticed that many young students have developed a great interest for graphic design. Type Fun-Damental will provide the basics of typography as well as introductory elements of graphic design.</p>

<h1>Strategy</h1>
<p>The goal of this website is that I want the users to grasp the basics of typography and graphic design. I provided a lot of visuals throughout the website. The visuals are simple and easy on the eyes, so it’s friendly for the learners to follow. I divided the website into three sections which are, “Letterform Basics,” “Typeface Classification,” and “Alphabet Variation.” Each section has helpful visuals in the beginning followed by exercises that the users can quiz themselves.</p>
<h1>Site Objectives</h1>
<p>I want the users to grasp the basic understandings of typography by going through the visuals and solving the quizzes as they go along. I am hoping that they will be helpful. </p>
<h1>Success Metrics</h1>
<p>Before the users begin navigating through the website, I gave them a pretest to do. The pretest is located at the bottom of the website and is easy to find. I gave them questions that they will encounter when they actually begin their lessons on typography and graphic design. After they have reviewed the materials, the learners will have quizzes at the end to solve.</p>
<h1>Scope</h1>
<p>The website provides information and visuals that teach about the basics of typography. After they are introduced, they are followed by quizzes and activities at the end. The learners can test themselves after reviewing the content. The exercises and quizzes are straight-forward and easy once the learners have reviewed the visuals and information for each section. The visuals vary by sections. Some represents the typography anatomy, typeface classification, and variations of alphabet. </p>
<h1>Structure</h1>
<p>The quizzes that I provide to the users are multiple-choice based and fill in the blanks. There are a lot of terms that are introduced in this website. I thought that those two quizzes were suitable for the learning objectives that I am pursuing.

<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>I learned that organization is the key when creating a website that requires many pages. I developed a lot of pages for this website and learned that organizing my thoughts on design and user experience was very important. Especially when it came to creating the stylesheet for my html, it was good to organize how I want the website to look like beforehand or else I would have been very confused and the website wouldn’t look like what I wanted it to be. For example, I learned that it’s best to keep the design of the website consistent in order for the codings to be simple and easy to follow. Otherwise, the website will be all mixed up and it will be difficult for me to edit the websites in the future. I also thought that planning for a website was important as well. It’s good to lay out what I want to include in the content before coding. It will save me from running into coding troubles. Overall, I learned that organization and planning are very important when coding websites.</p>
